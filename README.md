Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm [Federico](https://federicoterzi.com/), a passionate Software Engineer who loves building great products.

I consider myself a [Generalizing Specialist](http://agilemodeling.com/essays/generalizingSpecialists.htm),
with significant experience in **Front-end development** and **System Programming**.
I also have a Master's degree in Computer Engineering.

Iâ€™m **product-oriented**. Despite loving the technical side, I also deeply care about user experiences and design.

I'm currently working on [Borumi](https://borumi.com), a video editor that allows creators to produce content in a fraction of the time. I'm also the creator of [Espanso](https://espanso.org), an open-source text expander used by thousands of people every day. You can find the others [here](https://federicoterzi.com/projects).

If you like technical topics, you might also enjoy my [Blog](https://federicoterzi.com/blog) and [YouTube channel](https://youtube.com/c/FedericoTerzi).

I've also led the development of multiple open-source projects as part of my job, such as:

* [Scooby](https://github.com/AnimaApp/scooby) - An Open-source regression and fidelity testing framework
